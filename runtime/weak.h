/*
The weak table is a hash table governed by a single spin lock.
An allocated blob of memory, most often an object, but under GC any such 
allocation, may have its address stored in a __weak marked storage location 
through use of compiler generated write-barriers or hand coded uses of the 
register weak primitive. Associated with the registration can be a callback 
block for the case when one of the allocated chunks of memory is reclaimed. 
The table is hashed on the address of the allocated memory.  When __weak 
marked memory changes its reference, we count on the fact that we can still 
see its previous reference.

So, in the hash table, indexed by the weakly referenced item, is a list of 
all locations where this address is currently being stored.
 
For ARR, we also keep track of whether an arbitrary object is being 
deallocated by briefly placing it in the table just prior to invoking 
dealloc, and removing it via code_clear_deallocating just prior to memory 
reclamation.
