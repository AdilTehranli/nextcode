        This repository hosts the Code compiler, the Code standard library,
        the Code runtime, SourceKit, and IDE support for the Code language.
        It does *not* track feedback on Xcode and other closed source Apple
        developer software such as CodeUI and UIKit; please direct it to
        [Feedback Assistant](https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting)
        instead.

    attributes:
      label: Description
      description: >
        A concise description of what causes the problem, in human language.
        Though not required, it may help us to more accurately triage the issue
        as well as understand a non-trivial test case.

      description: >
        Provide a test case, preferably in a Markdown codeblock, and explain
        how to build or run it to reproduce the problem. If the problem is a
        poor or unexpected error, warning, fix-it, or output, please show
        them. Consider reducing the test case to the smallest amount of code
        possible â€” a smaller test case is easier to reason about and more
        appealing to contributors.
