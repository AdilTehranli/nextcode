# Welcome to Code Programming Language !

Code is an innovative programming language that combines the efficiency and speed of Go with the elegance and practicality of Visual Basic. It's designed to be fast, safe, and suitable for both systems programming and rapid application development.

```main.code
module Program

  procedure main()

    Output("Hello World!")

  end procedure

end program 
```

## Key Features

- **Speed**: Enjoy the performance of Go, making your applications run at lightning speed.
- **Multiple Dispatch**: Inspired by Julia, Code24 allows for sophisticated function behaviors based on argument types.
- **Borrow Checking**: Borrow checking principles from Rust ensure memory safety without a garbage collector.
- **Practicality**: With a syntax as intuitive as Python's, Code24 is easy to learn and practical to use.
- **Compilation**: Supports both ahead-of-time and just-in-time compilation, similar to Dart, for flexibility in deployment.
- **Null Safety**: Borrowing from Swift, Code24 ensures null safety without the need for special syntax like "?" after data types.
- **Expressions**: Code24 adopts Kotlin and Rust's approach where most control-flow structures are expressions.
- **Collections**: Null-safe methods on collections are a feature, taking cues from Swift to prevent common errors.
- **Memory Control**: Offers close-to-the-metal memory and hardware control akin to Objective-C, with the safety of Go.
- **`if let` Syntax**: Swift's `if let` construct is part of Code24, allowing for concise and safe unwrapping of optionals.
- **Syntax**: Code24 uses a VB-based syntax that is familiar and easy to understand.
- **Cross-Compiling**: Seamlessly use C# and C/C++, R, Ruby, Fortran and many other's libraries within Code24, thanks to its cross-compiling capabilities.
- **Interop**: Enjoy smooth interoperation with C++ code and libraries.
- **Visibility and Accessibility**: Introduces hybrid visibility and accessibility modifiers for classes and subroutines.
